# 🗄️ SQL & Database Design Projects

This repository showcases hands-on SQL and database design projects focused on
relational schema modeling, normalization, and real-world business use cases.

The projects demonstrate my ability to design structured databases, write
meaningful SQL queries, and translate business requirements into logical data models.
