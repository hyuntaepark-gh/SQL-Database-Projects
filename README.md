This repository showcases hands-on SQL and database design projects focused on
relational schema modeling, normalization, and real-world business use cases.

The projects demonstrate my ability to design structured databases, write
meaningful SQL queries, and translate business requirements into logical data models.

## 📁 Project: TradingDB – Relational Database Design

### 🔍 Project Overview
The TradingDB project simulates a real-world business database that manages
clients, contracts, and company-related information.  
It focuses on schema design, normalization, and query-based data analysis.

Key objectives:
- Design a normalized relational database schema
- Define entity relationships and constraints
- Write SQL queries to retrieve business insights
